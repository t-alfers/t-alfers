# Hello there 👋

### Psychometrician & Web Developer

I'm Tobias Alfers, a passionate Psychometrician and Web Developer based in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria. My career is a blend of psychology and technology, enabling me to bring unique insights to both fields.

💡 As a Psychometrician, I specialize in designing, developing, and implementing tools for psychological assessment. In the realm of psychometrics, I have developed a strong expertise in Item Response Theory (IRT).

💻 As a Web Developer, I bring the same analytical rigor to code. I'm experienced in a range of programming languages and technologies, with a special love for Julia. I enjoy building sleek, user-friendly websites and applications that are not only visually appealing but also backed by solid, efficient code.

🔍 I'm always exploring the intersection between psychometrics and web development, and I love the challenge of integrating complex psychometric principles into web-based applications.

<!--
🔗 Here, you'll find a portfolio of my projects, ranging from psychometric analysis tools to full-stack web development. I'm open to collaboration and always eager to learn from other developers.
